<p> The value of education is constantly pressured in our society. Though this idea is not neccessarily a bad one, it is not an easy task. Finding opportunities that are actually accessable and resoureful are very difficult, especially when you cannot afford it. Education over the last decade has become completely unaffordable and biased. Public colleges, set up for those who are underepresented in society, are accepting less and less minorities. </p>
<p>There is a standard in society that in order to have a well established life, you need a good job, and the only way to get a good job is to go to college (unless you a million dollar idea). Essentially, education is a big and valued part ofd society. But the issue rises: How are you are you supposed to attempt to be successful when everything is created to push you down? 60% of all college students receive no financial help from their parents, but college tution nowadays costs more than a car. The average annual tuition at a four-year U.S. public college in the fall of 2009 is $7,020, a 6.5% jump from 2008.  The average cost at a private college is $26,273. These figures do not include costs for room and board.  Simply tuition.</p>
<p>Regardless of the cost and social class, racial and gender bias is a looming issues in applying for college. Education should not be this difficult to obtain in a society like ours. People all over the world would die to have basic education provided, so why should we have to struggle to try to obtain something that is already available in our nation? Together, we need to create more foundations and forms of scholarships, for those who cannot afford it, and make guidance and prepartion programs more available.</p>
