  <center><p>Comes down to standards in etiquette and social harmony; caste. Ethics, Morals, Virtue, and Quality. In its descriptive sense, "morality" refers to personal or cultural values, codes of conduct or social mores. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. Descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense. Social Morality is a moral philosophy which states: we live in a global-society with all of us being connected, none of us live in isolation. We have an effect on others, and others have an effect on us. Humans are globally linked into a large macrosociety, and as such we are all interconnected, every person on the planet.

As a global-society, we need in place a system of morals and values. A system every rational and intelligent human being would agree with, and in fact most already follow social morality in some regards.

Social Morality is simply doing the right thing, which we are already born knowing, with the basic principal of, "Act according to that maxim whereby you treat the world as an ends and never as a mere means. Why
Why are we in need of social morality? Why do individuals need to start following social morality, even if they feel they are already moral? Turn on you television to the local news and you will see it. We are not getting along and living together as a society, in fact we are slowly tearing society apart. Why is this, because we don't follow social morality.

We must admit we are rational intelligent thinking human beings, and as a rational thinking beings, we must ask ourselves, "Are we acting morally?". As we have merged into a global-society, there is a need for a global system of morals and values. Even if you believe you are acting morally, think about all your actions in a given day, "Is every action moral?". Is it possible your morals might have become slightly skewed? As rational beings we are bound to follow a system of morals and values, but are we truly thinking about our morals and values.</p></center>
